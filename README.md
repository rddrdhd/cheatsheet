# Cheatsheet

## 01 - CMake for C++ main and CUDA kernel
Original task from https://code.it4i.cz/training/cuda_2022/-/tree/main/hello_world, but my task was a to create and run it in files main.cpp, say_hello.cu and say_hello.h

You can build and run it on Karolina cluster using  ``./run.sh `` script.

It says "Hello GPU world from thread n/N, block n/N, my global index is n/N" using CUDA

## 02 - OpenVDB + NanoVDB library (re)build
Building the lib on cluster/node

## 03 - OpenVDB HelloWorld with CMake
Building and running Hello World using previously built library
